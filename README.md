# Landing Page Project

In this project I built on top of the landing page provided by Udacity.
The page has three sections that were added statically and two sections that were added dynamically using DOM API methods.
Through the DOM API I created a navigation bar that contains the names of the sections that allow you to scroll down to the respective section when you click on them.
Also, I adjusted CSS properties to allow for smooth scrolling.
